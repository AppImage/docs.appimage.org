Introduction
============

AppImage provides a way for upstream developers to provide "native" binaries for Linux users just the same way they could do for other operating systems. It allow packaging applications into one binary that runs on any common Linux based operating system, e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, RHEL, openSUSE or Arch. AppImages come with all dependencies that cannot be assumed to be part of each target system in a recent enough version and will run on most Linux distributions without further modifications.

AppImage is the format, and AppImageKit_ provides a reference implementation.

The following section provides an overview of the AppImage idea, the motives behind AppImage, and explains the basic concepts. Furthermore, there are some words on upstream packaging.
