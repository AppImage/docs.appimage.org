.. |appimage_preferred_source| replace:: In general, AppImages should be officially distributed by application authors. If application authors don't provide an AppImage, you should create an issue and ask them to start packaging the application as AppImage, or make a pull / merge request to add the creation of one if possible. Converting existing packages should only be used as a last resort if the application authors won't provide an officially distributed AppImage.
.. |valid_resolutions| replace:: ``8x8``, ``16x16``, ``20x20``, ``22x22``, ``24x24``, ``28x28``, ``32x32``, ``36x36``, ``42x42``, ``48x48``, ``64x64``, ``72x72``, ``96x96``, ``128x128``, ``160x160``, ``192x192``, ``256x256``, ``384x384``, ``480x480`` and ``512x512``
.. |supported_icon_formats| replace:: Supported icon formats are ``png`` and ``svg``. (``xpm`` is also supported, but deprecated and shouldn't be used for new packages). The valid resolutions for raster icons are |valid_resolutions|.
