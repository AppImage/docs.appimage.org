=======

The AppImage project documentation is brought to you by `the AppImage team <https://github.com/AppImage>`__ and other `contributors <https://github.com/AppImage/docs.appimage.org/graphs/contributors>`__. The source code is available `on GitHub <https://github.com/AppImage/docs.appimage.org>`__.

If you have further questions or need additional support, please feel free to contact the AppImage team:


GitHub discussions
------------------

An easy way to contact us is to ask questions on the `AppImage GitHub discussions page <https://github.com/orgs/AppImage/discussions>`__. Questions are usually answered in one to two days, and you'll get notified as soon as someone answered you. Posts stay, so you can always keep track of the conversation. You can also browse through other posts to see if someone else had the same question or problem.


IRC
---

An alternative way to contact is us to join our `IRC channel #appimage <ircs://irc.libera.chat/appimage>`__ on `Libera.Chat <https://libera.chat>`__ (`webchat <https://web.libera.chat/#AppImage>`__). While this may be faster, you have to stay online for some hours until someone checks the chat and can help you, so don't give up too quickly, and e.g. leave the tab open in the background if you can. Please read `this article <https://workaround.org/getting-help-on-irc/>`__ before joining the IRC chat if you are new to IRC.

   The ``#appimage`` channel on freenode has been abandoned and is not maintained by the AppImage project. The channel ``##appimage`` (which was created after ``#appimage`` was forcefully removed because it mentioned our move) has never been official and has never been maintained by us.

   Please see `this article <https://www.devever.net/~hl/freenode_abuse2>`__ for more information on what happened to our channel and why we planned to transition to a new network.
